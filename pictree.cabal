description:
    This is a tool and library that takes a format string as well as image
    files and produce an internal representation of an image tree whose layout
    is automatic. This representation can then be converted into whatever you
    like ; the only currently implemented output format is TiKZ.

    The format string '1 2 (mat 3 3 3-11) 12' will produce four horizontal
    blocks of the same size, with the third one being filled by a 3Ã—3 matrix.
    Numbers are the identifiers of the files.

    Some size specifiers are being implemented.
